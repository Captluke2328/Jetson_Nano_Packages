1. On windows, go to "Turn Windows feature on and off" and enable "Windows subsytem for linux" OK and restart the windows
2. Repeat above step and enable "Virtual Machine Platform" OK and restart the windows
3. Then open windows shells or cmd as admin 
4. Then type this command to enable wsl2 linux distribution >> wsl --set-default-version 2
5. For first time installation, it will print "WSL2 2 requires an update to its kernel component". To solve this, we need to download and install
   WSL2 Linux Kernel Update packagefor x64 machines.
   
   Please refer to this link to download this package >> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual
   WSL2 Package >> https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi
   Download and Install !
   
6. Then type this command to enable wsl2 linux distribution >> wsl --set-default-version 2. Now, it should say "Operation Completed Successfully" 
   indicating we have install WSL2
7. Next install Ubuntu 18 Developer tools from Microsoft Store. Then setup username and password accordingly
8. To enable Desktop environment, we will need to download VcXsrV Windows X Server. 
   Please download at this link >> https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt install xfce4
   select gdm3 if prompt appear
   
10. Next, type this command in linux terminal:

    NOTE : take note on nameserver which we will use later to VcXsrv connection. This IP is referring to windows IP address
           which can be obtained by "ipconfig" command otherwise the connection will resfuse
    
    Next open :
    vi ~/.bashrc
