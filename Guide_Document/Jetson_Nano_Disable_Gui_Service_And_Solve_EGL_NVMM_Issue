## This userguide on how to disable GUI and some RAM in Jetson Nano in console mode ##

#!/bin/bash

# Disable GUI to free up more RAM
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user

# Disable ZRAM
sudo systemctl disable nvzramconfig.service

# Default to Max-N power mode
sudo nvpmodel -m 0

# Re-enable GUI
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target

## In my previous project "Autonomous Human Follower Robot". I have an issue with
[gstreamer] gstBufferManager -- failed to map EGLImage from NVMM buffer.

To solve this problem, run following command.

cd /path/to/your/jetson-inference/build
cmake -DENABLE_NVMM=OFF ../
make
sudo make install

The NVMM issue will solved.
