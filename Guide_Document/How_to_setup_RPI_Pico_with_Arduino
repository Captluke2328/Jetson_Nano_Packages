## This userguide explain on how to setup Raspberry PiCo with Arduino IDE.

1. See this link for details : https://www.hackster.io/LithiumION/program-raspberry-pi-pico-using-arduino-ide-6efd43
2. Open Arduino IDE and add this link into Preferences Section : https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico/releases/download/global/package_rp2040_index.json

3. Then go to tools --> Board Managers --> Search for PiCO --> Then download PiCO library
   a. Arduino Mbed OS RP2040 Boards By Arduino
   b. Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040

4. Then press BOOTSEL button and plug the USB to your PC. Pico will appear as mass storage device.

5. From Arduino IDE, example section, upload any sketch to PiCO. I'm using Blink sketch or empty sketch. Don't worry, because port is not 
   available for the first time. Don't panic, just click to upload the sketch.

6. First time compilation will take some time due to prameture drivers. But after some time the new "Com (Raspberry Pi Pico)" will be installed.

7. It will no longer appear as mass storage unit and the COM port is now available.
8. Next longer select BOOTSEL button after this.
