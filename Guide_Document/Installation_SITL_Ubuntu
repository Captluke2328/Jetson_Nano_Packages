# This guide will show on how to install SITL in Jetson Nano ubuntu.
# Before proceed, with this step please ensure to install all the required packages as in describe in "Installation of Pixhawk and Jetson Nano" packages
# to ensure it mets all the dependecies and prevent conflict during ubuntu.sh -y installation.

# Install below packages
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ sudo pip install pexpect 
$ git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot
$ cd ardupilot
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

$ ./Tools/environment_install/install_prereqs_ubuntu.sh -y

# if you have an issues with PyGame installation. Please refer to user guide "Install_PyGame_JetsonNano" or find forum title
"install pygame on Jetson Nano from NVIDIA forum". Follow the guide there.

# Then load the profiles
$ . ~/.profile (Space in between . and ~ - reload this profile if sim_vehicle not found)

# Start the simulator
$ cd ardupilot/Arducopter

# First run to write the virtual EEPROM. After default parameters are loaded then can start simulator normally.
$ sim_vehicle.py -w 

# Run this command to run the simulator
$ sim_vehicle --console --map (To invoke default map and console)
$ sim_vehicle --out=udpout:127.0.0.1:14551 --console --map (to connect into mission planner)
$ sim_vehicle --out=/dev/ttyACM0 (to connect into Pixhawk via USB connection)

# Run this command method to enable the MAVproxy console
$ mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyACM0 --baudrate 57600 --out 192.168.137.1:14550 --aircraft MyCopter (Using Pixhawak USB and connect it into mission planner)
$ mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyACM0 --baudrate 57600 --aircraft Mycopter                           (Using Pixhawk USB without port forwarding)
$ mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyACM0 --baudrate 57600 --out=udp:10.60.216.198:14550                 (Using Pixhawk USB and port forward data from Mavproxy (Ground Station) to Copter (IP address). 10.60.** address is from ifconfig of the connected wifi.
$ mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyACM0,921600 --out=udp:10.60.216.198:14550                           (To ignore the "baudrate" statememnt. This approach will work too)
$ mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyACM0 --out=udp:10.60.216.198:14550                                  (Override default baudrate because we have defined this in SERIAL2 = 921600 earlier)

$ mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyTHS1,921600                                                         (Using Uart Tx RX of Pixhawk without port forwarding)
$ mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyTHS1,921600 --out=udp:10.60.216.198:14550                           (Using Uart Tx Rx of Pixhawk with port forwarding)

NOTE : To run python script use port forwarded udp (see line 44 below to connect into MAVProxy as follow:
connect_copter.py
from dronekit import *
''' Using SITL connection '''
#connection_string = '127.0.0.1:14550'

'''Using SiTL Connection from  different computer - This IP address below refer to receiver device for example RPI 
This IP address is based on given ZeroTier IP address. Here we forwarded sim_vehicle output from computer A to computer B

Example:
1. Open SITL from my desktop and put following as follow 
   This IP address is referring to RPI or our Drone

   sim_vehicle.py --console --map --out 192.168.195.190:14553
   
2. On RaspberryPi replace '127.0.0.1:14550' with above address - See example below
   This 127.0.0.1:14550 used only for local SITL in local computer.
   
'''
connection_string = '192.168.195.190:14553'

'''Using port forwarding from MavProxy'''
#connection_string = '10.60.216.198:14550'

'''Using UART serial Rx -> Tx and Tx -> Rx connection'''
#connection_string = '/dev/ttyTHS1,921600'

'''Using USB Connection'''
#connection_string = '/dev/ttyACM0'

vehicle = connect(connection_string,wait_ready = True)
print("Virtual Copter is Ready !")

Tips : Refer to page ardupilot.org/mavproxy/docs/gettingstarted/quickstart.html



################################### New Update on how to Install SITL in Ubuntu (Virtualbox, WISL, Ubuntu Desktop ###########################################
This userguide tell on how to install SITL in Ubuntu 18 either it from Virtualbox, WISL windows installation or Ubuntu desktop

First run following command.
1. sudo apt-get update
2. sudo apt-get upgrade
3. Next we're going to install python2.7
  To install python2.7, run following command:
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo apt install software-properties-common
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
  sudo apt install python2 --> Which will download python2.7
  
  Once completed run python to check if python2.7 is installed
  python --version
  
4. Next we're going to install python 2 pip. To install pip, use following command
  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py # Fetch get-pip.py for python 2.7 
  sudo python get-pip.py
  pip --version
  
  Once completed run velow command to to determine if installed pip is refer to python 2.7
  whereis pip --> 
  
5. Next we're going to install python 3 pip. To install pip, use following command
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   
   Once completed run python to check if pip installed pip is refer to python 3.6
   whereis pip
   
   
6. Before installing SITL, modify following line accordingly

   In ./Tools/environment_install/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh
   change pymavlink version to 2.0.6, and dronecan to 1.0.14
   
   Modify as follow:
   pymavlink==2.4.33
   dronecan==1.0.14
   
   Once this step completed you're safe to run SITL installation.
